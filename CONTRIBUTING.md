# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to improve these templates!

## Adding a Template

1. Create a new file in `templates/`
2. Follow the structure of existing templates:
   - Project description placeholder at top
   - Stack section
   - Commands section
   - Structure (ASCII tree)
   - Conventions
   - "Do NOT" anti-patterns
   - Environment variables
   - Testing notes
3. Use `[PLACEHOLDER]` format for things users need to fill in
4. Add your template to the README table
5. Open a PR

## Improving Existing Templates

- Fix errors or outdated info
- Add commonly-needed sections
- Improve clarity
- Add better examples

## Guidelines

- **Keep it scannable** — headers, bullets, code blocks
- **Be specific** — vague advice doesn't help
- **Include anti-patterns** — what NOT to do is as valuable as what to do
- **Test your template** — use it on a real project before submitting
- **Don't over-engineer** — start minimal, expand when needed
